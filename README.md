# debug-cmake-FindMPI

This package contains the standard CMake FindMPI.cmake along with supporting files and modifications to aid in debugging problems.

To use it, run ```./try.sh```. This will autogenerate a new CMake configuration directory, attempt to find MPI, and leave a log of what happened in ```latest.log```.
